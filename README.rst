UFL - Unified Form Language
===========================

The Unified Form Language (UFL) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational
forms. More precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing
finite element spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a
notation close to mathematical notation.

UFL is part of the FEniCS Project.
